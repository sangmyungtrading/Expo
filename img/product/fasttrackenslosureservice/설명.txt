Using standardised building blocks and automated configuration and design tools, Expoâ€™s Fast-Track service can deliver you tailor-made enclosures within weeks.

Expo manufactures the enclosure to your specifications and delivers to you component certified. If this is an Ex p enclosure, then the purge system will already be installed and tested. The enclosure can then be populated at your facility.

For systems using purge & pressurization, Expo holds populated enclosure certificates for ATEX & IECEx, so it can offer a full certification service on the finished system, giving significant time and cost benefits. For most projects, provided we have received all the required documentation, the final inspection process is quick and straightforward and may not need a site visit by an Expo Certification Engineer.
