      <description>Using standardised building blocks and automated configuration and design tools, Expo’s Fast-Track service can deliver you tailor-made enclosures within weeks.
Expo manufactures the enclosure to your specifications and delivers to you component certified. If this is an Ex p enclosure, then the purge system will already be installed and tested. The enclosure can then be populated at your facility.
For systems using purge &amp;amp; pressurization, Expo holds populated enclosure certificates for ATEX &amp;amp; IECEx, so it can offer a full certification service on the finished system, giving significant time and cost benefits.</description>

      <description>Overview of Hazardous Areas What is a Hazardous Area? A hazardous area is a location where the potential for fire or explosion exists caused by the presence of ignitable gases or dusts in the atmosphere. Examples of these locations include oil &amp;amp; gas facilities, chemical processing plants and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Download our handy Hazardous Location Chart from the Resources section.
Hazardous Area Classification Hazardous areas are defined as:
  “Zones” under worldwide IEC standards (and their local versions, such as ATEX in Europe)</description>

      <description>Enclosure Certification Service  In addition to the design and manufacture of Purged and Pressurised enclosures, Expo can provide an IECEx or ATEX Certification service once the enclosure has been populated by the panel builder.
 Our Certification Engineer works with the customer through the following steps, to make sure the design is compliant with the Expo’s Schedule of Limitations (SoL), ensuring successful project completion. The SoL defines the scope of what can be certified under Expo’s populated enclosure certificate and is broad enough to cover most applications.</description>

      <description>화학 및 석유 화학 산업에 존재하는 위험은 대부분 시야에서 가려진다. 우리는 보호에 대한 본능을 개발하지 않았으며, 재해 예방을 위해 위험요소를 연구하고 긍정적인 조치를 취해야 한다. 이와 같은 전형적인 석유화학 공장에는 위험의 잠재적 원천이 매우 많습니다. 명백하고 명확하지 않은 것도 있습니다. 우리 모두는 보통 여러 가지 상황에서 모든 것이 끔찍하게 잘못되는 결과를 보아왔다. 전기 위험으로부터 보호하기 위한 조치를 취할 수는 있지만, 어떤 상황에서는 아무리 보호해도 도움이 되지 않습니다.
